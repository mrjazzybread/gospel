- Discuss future development:
  - it has been said in the mathematical library meeting that gospel will move
    away from the disctinction between `bool` and `prop`. Should we tackle this
    in a near future?
    Online discussion can happen in [#287](https://github.com/ocaml-gospel/gospel/issues/287)
  - There has been some discussion and experimentation about having only one
    unnamed logical model for an OCaml type. What's the status of this decision?
