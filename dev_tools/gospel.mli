val tast :
  verbose:bool -> compile:bool -> string list -> Tast.s_signature file list
(** [tast ~verbose files] receives a list of file names that are either [.mli]
    (OCaml interfaces) or [.gospel] (compiled Gospel modules). Each [.mli] file
    is type checked in a context where all files previous to it are visible in
    the form of a Gospel module. Consequently the order in which files appear in
    the list matter: if a file [f1] depends on [f2], [f2] should appear before
    [f1]. The [verbose] flag controls if the parsed file is printed into the
    standard output. If each file is valid, we produce a list of typed
    signatures for each [.mli] file in [files].

    This function fails with an exit code [1] if:

    - The [files] list contains duplicates.
    - Any of the files do not have the extension [.gospel] or [.mli].
    - Any of the [.mli] files do not parse or type check.
    - Any of the [.gospel] files are not compatible with the current version of
      Gospel. *)
