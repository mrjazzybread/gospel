(**This is a priority queue whose keys are {i low} nonnegative integers. *)

(**This queue is optimized for throughput, that is, speed. When an element is
   extracted out of the queue, the queue may retain a pointer to this element.
   This creates a memory leak: that is, the existence of this pointer can
   prevent the garbage collector from freeing this element. In practice, we do
   not expect this to be a problem, especially in scenarios where the queue
   itself is not long-lived. *)

(**[extract q] extracts an element out of the queue [q] and returns it. This
   element has minimum priority among all of the elements that are currently
   present in the queue. If the queue is empty, [None] is returned.

   Time complexity: {m O(p)}. If the queue is used in a {i monotonic} manner

   high as the priority of the last element that was returned by {!extract})
   then the time complexity of {m n} calls to {!extract} is only {m O(n+p)}.
   Indeed, in this monotonic scenario, the cost of scanning the queue's main
   array, so as to find the next element with minimum priority, is shared
   between all invocations of {!extract}. *)
