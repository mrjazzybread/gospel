(** This module contains a typechecker that uses the Inferno library, which

    type constraints. *)

(* The following functions make use of "deep types". These are a
   special encoding provided by Inferno when we already know a type
   before we begin typechecking. This is useful for logical functions
   and predicates since these are required to have arguments with
   explicitly annotated types (since Gospel does not support let
   polymophism). After constructing a deep type, we then call the
   [deep] function which returns a variable [x] and creates an Inferno
   constraint stating that [x] must be equal to the provided deep
   type. *)

   Inferno can solve the constraint, then it will build a typed
